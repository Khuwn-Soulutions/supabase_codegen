The `supabase_codegen_flutter` package is optimized for Flutter development, providing automatic environment loading and convenient service getters.

## Installation

Add the package to your Flutter project:

```bash
flutter pub add supabase_codegen_flutter
```

## Setup

<Steps>
### Environment File
Create a `config.env` file in your project root (default for Flutter):
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Pubspec Assets

Add `config.env` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - config.env
```

### Initialization

```bash
dart run supabase_codegen_flutter:init
```

</Steps>

## CLI Usage

Generate models optimized for Flutter:

```bash
dart run supabase_codegen_flutter:generate_types
```

## Integration & Service Getters

`supabase_codegen_flutter` provides a global `supabase` instance and specific clients for each service.

<Info>
  The `loadClientFromEnv()` function automatically loads from `config.env` and
  initializes Supabase for you.
</Info>

```dart
import 'package:supabase_codegen_flutter/supabase_codegen_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  await loadClientFromEnv();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

// Access services anywhere
final auth = authClient;
final storage = storageClient;
final functions = functionsClient;
final realtime = realtimeClient;
```

## Using Generated Tables

Generated tables in Flutter inherit from `SupabaseFlutterTable`, providing seamless integration with the Flutter client.

```dart
final usersTable = UsersTable();

// All queries use the pre-initialized Flutter client
final users = await usersTable.queryRows();
```
